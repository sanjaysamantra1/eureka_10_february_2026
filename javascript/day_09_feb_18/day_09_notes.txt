Promise
=======
-A promise is an object that holds the future value of an asynchronous operation.
-A Promise object represents a value that is not available now, but will be resolved/available at some point in the future.
-Promise object can have different states:- pending, resolved/fulfilled, rejected.
ex:-if we request some data from a server, promise promises us to get that data 
 that we can use in the future. 


ex: 
// fetch() returns a promise Object
let usersPromise= fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users');
console.log(usersPromise);
