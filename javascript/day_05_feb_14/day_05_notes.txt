map(func) – creates a new array from original array by calling func for every element.
	sort(func) – sorts the array in-place, then returns it.
	toSorted() - creates a new array and sorts
	reverse	() – reverses the array in-place, then returns it.
	toReversed() - creates a new array and reverses
	split/join – convert a string to array and back.
	reduce(func, initial) – calculate a single value over the array by calling func for 	each element and passing an intermediate result between the calls.
	flat()   - creates a new array with the elements of the subarrays concatenated into it.flat(Infinity) , flat() also removes holes in array
	flatMap() - maps each element in an array using a mapping function and then flattens the results into a new array


Array Copy
==========
let arr1 = [10, 20];
let arr2 = arr1;  // address/reference copy ( Not value copy)
-A new array is not being created, rather same address is being assigned to arr2
-Both arr1 & arr2 are holding the same address

let arr1 = [10, 20, [30, 31]];
let arr2 = [...arr1]; // value copy - shallow copy

let arr3 = [10, 20, [30, 31]];
let arr4 = structuredClone(arr3); // value copy - Deep Copy

-A shallow copy of an array is a copy whose nested elements share the same references.
 (Nested arrays will not be copied by value)
-A deep copy of an array is a copy whose nested elements do not share the same references.
