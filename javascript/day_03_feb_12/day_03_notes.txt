Variable Scope
==============
global :  declared outside a function , can be used by any function
function : declared inside a function, used by that function only
block : declared inside a block, used by that block only



How Javascript Works
====================
-When a JavaScript program runs, 1 Global Execution Context (anonymous) is created.
-For every function call, a new Function Execution Context (f1,f2,f3) is created.
-Execution Context = the environment in which code executes.
-Each execution context has two phases: 
	1. creation phase. (Memory is allocated for variables and functions; 'var' variables are initialized with undefined)
	2. execution phase. (Code is executed line by line; variables receive their assigned values and functions are invoked)



Hoisting
========
-var/let/const , For every variable memory is allocated during creation phase
  but only 'var' variables gets 'undefined' value
-var variables are accesible even before actual values being initialized , hoisting


Temporal Dead zone
==================
-var/let/const , For every variable memory is allocated during creation phase
  but only 'var' variables gets 'undefined' value
-let and const variables dont get any value
 b: <value unavailable>
 c: <value unavailable>
-they are accesible only after they are initialized with actual values
-if we try to access them before they are initialized with actual values,
erro is thrown : Cannot access 'b' before initialization



functions
=========
1. Function Declaration
2. Function Expression
3. Arrow Function


Arrow Function Limitations
===========================
-Arrow functions shouldn't be used as object method


Arrow Function Benefits
========================
-Shorter syntax
-No Function Keyword
-implicit return
-Body is optional



HigherOrder Function
=====================
-A function which takes another function as arguement, is called higher order.


CallBack
========
-A function that is passed as arguement to another function , is callback function
